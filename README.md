# Concept-Imagination

Hi Viewer, I see that you are here in my Concept Imagination repository. This is my own work and few important(already existing), where I have tried to understand why and what mathematics of various stuff stand aside for the real intutuitions behind of any/every Machine Learning, Deep Learning concepts. I am looking forward to add more and more concepts which clings over my head and very eager to improvise with your discussions.  

Using this? It is a prerequisite that you know/ understand concepts on the basic level.

Usage clause- The topics cover intutitions and some may need for you to read documents in 'Mathematical Investigations' repository which is a part of my github repositorie. In regards to such prerequisite, I have mentioned where ever it is needed to refer. The file name elaborates what I wanted to share. Example: If you see about file 'Bias', it covers very imaginative concept about it. 

Contribution/Contact: I am opening to collaborting with like minded researches/mathematicians/statisticians/Data Scientists/Machine Learning Engineers/ any one who is interested in contributing or improving the already published understanding. I deeply respect the mutual exchange of knowledge and ideas. IN regards to this, Please contact me @ https://www.linkedin.com/in/vamsikrishnakolaparthi/

I am also open to receive ideas for my next understanding topics. However you need to connect with me through Linkedin. Please feel free to share this to anyone who might need this document. I would also appreciate postive feedback, comments and social media mentions for the hardwork put in.
